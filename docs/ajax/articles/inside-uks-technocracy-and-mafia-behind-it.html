In other words: life will kick you in the balls. Especially so when you think outside the box and have an independent world view which used to be completely normal when humans still had conscience, but now became a unique characteristic. The society that promises its members security, well paid jobs and fast cars, in exchange for them burning out lives for corporate interests, will betray anyone who decides to discover alternative paths, testing his/her vision and how much they really want to go their own way. One's goal is to persevere despite the challenge and develop a reality tunnel in which the problems that are faced are only to the advantage, to forge a personality that is capable of true success and not some cheap pastiche of a human achievement. I used to think that higher education, dedication to profession, and businessmanship were conservative qualities.

A lot of people assume that the UK is a fair democracy and a developed country, and don't realise that it's being transformed into a close technocracy run by the elite &mdash; a bunch of amoral capitalists with links in the government who try to run a country like it's a start-up. Eventually they will end up like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2LwIiKhczo\"><span class=\"tm\">wework</span></a>, and ruin the whole country, making people say <span class=\"tm\">wemisswork</span>. To start real political education, everyone must <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda:_The_Formation_of_Men%27s_Attitudes\">\n  pick up this book</a> from their local library to learn the basis of how technological societies function. Tech Nation is a mere propaganda tool the government uses to make their activity seem legit and justified as explained in this article.</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div class=\"order-lg-2 order-2 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column col-lg-6\">\n    <p style=\"font-size: medium;\">The 2011 website states: <span class=\"tm\">The Tech City Investment Organisation (TCIO) is dedicated to driving investment to the area.

Yet Tech Nation apparently IS an endorsing body, and although they've stepped up from simple \"networking\" advice to proper knee-deep, \"government contacts\" corruption scheme (see below), they still hire 0 professionals in computing who would be able to properly assess applications.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"order-lg-1 order-1 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden col-lg-6\" id=\"fig-9848\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img class=\"border rounded img-fluid\" alt=\"Figure 1: Tech City 2011 Web Site\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1050' height='827'/%3E\" data-io>\n      <noscript>\n        <img class=\"border rounded img-fluid\" alt=\"Figure 1: Tech City 2011 Web Site\" src=\"life-sucks/img/appshot-Safari-Tech.gif\">\n      </noscript>\n    </p>\n    <h5 id=\"figure-1-tech-city-2011-web-site\" class=\"m-0 d-inline-block\" style=\"background: white;\">\n      Figure 1: Tech City 2011 Web Site\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"position-absolute\" style=\"opacity: 0; top: 1rem; right: 1rem;\" id=\"ce513\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"#\">Go Back</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <em>Exceptionally Talented Visa</em> route in the UK is the best one in the world, as it does not require you to have any capital when entering GB, and you can settle in the country in 3-5 years. However, when there are real endorsing bodies, such as <em>The Royal Academy of Engineering, Arts Council England, Royal Society</em> and <em>British Society</em> that were granted their Royal Charters and employ respectable fellows to process applications, Tech Nation used to be a little Shoreditch-based start-up that initially was helping the \"silicon valley\" of London, the Silicon Roundabout, with operations. In 2012, it was granted the \"endorsing\" body status by David Cameron, in the beginning of the government's bid to develop \"tech\" economy that benefits the establishment at the expense of tax payers and call it by the nice name \"<em>Industrial Strategy</em>\", using the myth of technological progress as a pretence to hide the real activity of industrialised corruption behind people's gullibility triggered by the idea that progress = better.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, there's already an organisation called <em>British Computer Society</em> which has the ability to provide IT professionals with a <a href=\"https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/become-chartered/chartered-it-professional/\">charter</a> (in Engineering, chartering is normal but not when you're a Software Engineer for some reason), but it's not nearly as good as Tech Nation to do the job: <em>BCS</em> actually has Computer Scientists (who number 0 at Tech Nation) and the Royal Charter (that numbers -1 at Tech Nation), but only when you have 0 honour, you can do the job that Tech Nation is doing.</p>\n\n<p>Don't believe me? Here's a sneak peek into their scheme and how Tech Nation is playing its dirty role in it. I single out each player in this unfolding techno-capitalist drama and briefly critique them to draw a bigger picture. Let's just start by looking at the key figure from the <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08843778/officers\">list of directors</a> of Tech Nation, and set off from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"-eileen-burbidge-mdash\"> Eileen BURBIDGE &mdash;</h3>\n\n<p>\"American venture capitalist, founding partner at Passion Capital.\" (Forbes), and a chair at Tech Nation. The key is <strong>venture capitalist</strong>, because the whole of Tech Nation's purpose is to serve venture capitalists like Ms Burbidge and her friends. Her <em>Passion Capital</em> company is located at White Bear Yard, Shoreditch and is a co-working space for trendy entrepreneurs, building \"startups\". In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swIoyaBUpEg\">Wired Documentary</a> (1:20), Ms Burbidge talks about how \"more than a half, if not two-thirds, of the businesses are from foreign-born entrepreneurs\". She says how fantastic it is, but she's a typical capitalist liar, who will say anything that presents reality in the light that supports their mode of power regardless of facts. If she is not a liar, why her company Tech Nation which I paid &pound;456 for processing of my application, is treating me like shit and robbing me of an opportunity to be a foreign-born entrepreneur and run a <a href=\"/\">Node.JS Development Company in London</a>, which is what makes London so fantastic according to her?</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div class=\"order-1 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden col\" id=\"fig-74268\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f1\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img class=\"ImageHolder border rounded img-fluid\" alt=\"Figure 2: Capitalist Liar Eileen Burbidge in Wired's 15min film praising London's tech culture.\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1708' height='960'/%3E\">\n      <noscript>\n        <picture>\n          <source\n            srcset=\"life-sucks/img/burbidge-1140.webp 1140w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-768.webp 768w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-576.webp 576w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-319.webp 319w\" type=\"image/webp\">\n          <img class=\"border rounded img-fluid\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"Figure 2: Capitalist Liar Eileen Burbidge in Wired's 15min film praising London's tech culture.\" src=\"life-sucks/img/burbidge-1140.jpg\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/burbidge-1140.jpg 1140w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-768.jpg 768w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-576.jpg 576w,life-sucks/img/burbidge-319.jpg 319w\">\n        </picture>\n      </noscript>\n    </p>\n    <h5 id=\"figure-2-capitalist-liar-eileen-burbidge-in-wireds-15min-film-praising-londons-tech-culture\"\n      class=\"m-0 d-inline-block\" style=\"background: white;\">\n      Figure 2: Capitalist Liar Eileen Burbidge in Wired's 15min film praising London's tech culture.\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"position-absolute\" style=\"opacity: 0; top: 1rem; right: 1rem;\" id=\"c6965\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"#\">Go Back</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Maybe I'm too harsh, she's just a director, she's not really aware of the unfair unethical practices at her company, or does she? The answer is yes she does, because after Tech Nation's Senior Manager lied about my application, I made a website, and sent it to each member of their useless team, consisting of 0 software engineers and who would have no idea who's actually telling the truth. I had a premium membership at the time and accumulated 45 credits, so right before Christmas Tech Nation's staff got a little message from me.</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div class=\"order-2 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column col-lg-6\">\n    <p>Needless to say, none of the cowards dared to answer anything, because they are despicable traitors of the country who think they can give visas in technology without even knowing basics of computer programming and have no courage to really look into the issue, preferring to ignore it altogether.

Maybe just <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10608507/filing-history\">PUBLIC.IO</a> which moved out there in 2018: <strong>Registered office address changed from White Bear Yard 144a Clerkenwell Road London EC1R 5DF United Kingdom to 25 Eccleston Place London SW1W 9NF on 7 February 2018</strong>. This company is a $100+ mil (I actually forgot now how I calculated that figure... but I used the <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10608507/filing-history\">confirmation statement</a>) fund run by Daniel Korski, former special adviser to David Cameron who set up Public.IO just 5 days after Cameron resigned, to offer \"growth programs\" to businesses wanting to sell to government, or the so-called \"gov-tech\", i.e., money laundering scheme consisting of securing government contracts through bought officials in Westminster, however it's not illegal because well that's how institutionalised corruption in England works nowadays. The logic goes: if you <strong>yourself</strong> believe what you're doing to rob people of a country is legit, then it must be. Typical capitalist thinking: according to <a href=\"/dm-korski\">Daily Mail</a>, PublicIO \"offers access to advisers working at the highest levels in government\", including advisers for <strong>Health Secretary</strong> Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Amber Rudd. In fact, the same article mentions how Burbidge was appointed by Korski, so obviously they are good pals and form what I call \"the establishment\".</p>\n\n<p>But so what Burbidge is a partner at a venture capital based firm, it doesn't stop her from being a director of Tech Nation, right (actually before her, it was run by a non-venture capitalist and was pretty useless, so useless that CEO of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-city-not-needed-says-huddle-founder-2015-10\">\n  Huddle said</a> that TN is not even needed back in 2015)? I wouldn't object if Tech Nation was a private company helping all these \"tech startups\" using their own venture capitals but do they? No, they are sponsored by the Government and are paid &pound;5 mil annually from tax payers' money, so that a bunch of people, who are already rich, can have \"favourable\" conditions. And you know, fuck them overall and let them play their little \"build your own technology\" constructor with nurses' and each other member's of the society money, but not only do they force their technology bubble hype upon the whole country, but <strong>ALSO</strong> actively sabotage applications for visas of people like me who just think differently from them and is not part of their \"who is your investor\" game. The real nature of Tech Nation's activity is proved by the screenshot below, which is also completely aligned with Korski's own policy of PublicIO.</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div class=\"order-lg-2 order-2 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column col-lg-6\">\n    <p style=\"font-size: medium;\">So it is <em>OK</em> now in a developed country to set up agencies that provide with \"direct contacts in Government\"?

Does that not sound like a conflict of interest, and also why <em>should</em> they provide such assistance, when the visa is for talented independent individuals and not really for tech businesses per se? This is because the visa is not for exceptionally talented, skilled young and passionate people. It is the visa for the talent farm of this startup ecosystem, where new little companies under the capitalists' patronage that don't want to provide proper sponsorship to employees, use the Tech Nation visa as a loophole to hire \"talent\" who is not talent at all, but are typical workforce in the IT. Economists don't have the ET1 visa, nor do lawyers, because they just do their job. This is what 99% of all Tech Nation visa holders do, just their job. But people for whom the ET1 visa was actually made, for whom Software Development and Computing, is the real creative process, like it would be for a proper artist, have to be discriminated against by a pseudo-endorsing body that thinks it's an authority to decide who can start businesses in the UK, which is not even legal according to the European legal framework (E-commerce directive):</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n  1. Member States shall ensure that the taking up and pursuit of the activity of an information society service provider may not be made subject to prior authorisation or any other requirement having equivalent effect.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This rule is there because it's essential human freedom of anyone to start a business, especially a digital one, today. It's like the freedom of speech. Can you imagine how offended you would be if there would be someone that you would have to go to ask to start a business, and they refused you that? You'd be enraged. Well, that's what Tech Nation has done to me, by lying about all of my achievements that were required of me when I was submitting the application.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned creativity just above, because I don't think I'm a developer, I'm an artist and a master of my craft. My company is called <a href=\"https://www.artd.eco\">Art Deco&trade;</a>, and you can't get more art than that when you own a software company. Software Engineering is the thing I do best in life (the highest grade I ever got at Uni was 97% in Web Computing), because I express myself with it, and because there are techniques and processes, like in any other art, that are employed to achieve the result &mdash; testing, documentation, implementation and building.

Deco starts for decoratif, because you don't want to live in a sterile factory-like environment, and have to introduce motives from nature, use materials like wood, i.e. to attribute to proper <em>culture</em> that is in the deepest core of the human being. Art Deco is for everyone who want to believe in a powerful human spirit and be religious but without affiliation with those who speak what they know not of. Tech Nation is then precisely the degeneration of culture, when everything is bought with money, there is no respect for human beings and everything is synthetic.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"order-1 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden col-lg-5\" id=\"fig-57253\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f4\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img class=\"ImageHolder border rounded img-fluid\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 540px,(max-width: 991.8px) 720px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 404px,479px\" alt=\"Figure 5: Howard Roark: I don't intend to build in order to have clients.

each other? OK let's look at another Tech Nation's ex director, <strong>Robin Klein</strong> (22 September 2015 &mdash; 15 June 2018) who together with his son Saul founded <em>LocalGlobe</em>, a seed round investment fund. LocalGlobal, apart from many other investment, also <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/echo-8-seed--730e481c#section-overview\">invests</a> in a company called Echo, which invents an alarm for taking medicine, and allows to order your prescription via an app (ofc this is super high-tech innovation isn't it). Personally, I think it's a ridiculous idea: Echo's founder said that he suffered from depression so that he wanted to get his antidepressants via post. That's just stupid, if you have depression, what you need to do is to get out as much as possible, and use any excuse to visit the outside world and interact with other humans. That allows the healthy flow of serotonin and actually improves the mood and heals your depression.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, ordering anti-depression pills via post, will isolate you even more wouldn't it? But that's exactly what <em>Tech Nation</em> and the Government want, to destroy any normal human ways of living, transform a society into a technocracy in which everyone is depressed, send them their pills by post, while streamlining all the public money into the pockets of the elite. Look just how much Tech Nation is happy for the acquisition of Echo by an American pharma company. The reason these corrupt liars who are pretending to benefit the society are so happy is actually because their director, Robin Klein, is going to be making money off the population.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But that's not all, not at all. Their high innovation multi-million alarm clock for taking medicine would be absolutely useless, if not their affiliation with NHS. There's a new branch of NHS, which is called NHSX, that was put there, by official version, to digitalise the National Health Service and modernise it. The real reason this unit is there, like the whole of the UK's capitalist technology, is to funnel the money out of the treasury into capitalists' hands and present it like they are doing a service to the society, and improving the standard of living. Who else, except for Tech Nation is excited about the Echo acquisition?</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"order-lg-1 order-2 col-lg-6\">\n    <p>Of course Saul is happy for his daddy's successful exit. The more money the better. But you might be wondering who is <span class=\"tm\">@matthewsgould</span>, and why Saul is cc'ing him at such an exciting moment? Well, Matthew Gould is his old pal, who was a British ambassador to Israel, when Mr Klein was the UK's first tech envoy to Israel, announced by David Cameron himself in Dec 2012, around the same time all this Tech Nation thing started.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"order-lg-2 order-1 col-lg-6\">\n    <div class=\"EmbeddedTweet my-auto\">\n      <div class=\"EmbeddedTweet-tweetContainer\">\n        <div class=\"a\">\n          <blockquote class=\"b\">\n            <div class=\"c\">\n              <a aria-label=\"Saul Klein\" class=\"e\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cape\">\n                <img alt=\"Saul Klein\" class=\"Avatar\" data-io>\n                <noscript>\n                  <img alt=\"Saul Klein\" class=\"Avatar\"\n                    src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/754440508018135040/hSqk3Tnf_normal.jpg\">\n                </noscript></a>\n              <div class=\"f\">\n                <a aria-label=\"Saul Klein\" class=\"TweetAuthor-link Identity u-linkBlend\"\n                  href=\"https://twitter.com/cape\">\n                  <div class=\"j\">\n                    <span class=\"h\">\n                      <span class=\"i\" title=\"Saul Klein\">Saul Klein</span>\n                      <span class=\"k\">\n                        <div class=\"o l\" aria-label=\"Verified Account\" title=\"Verified Account\" role=\"img\"></div>\n                      </span>\n                    </span>\n                    <span class=\"g\" title=\"@cape\" dir=\"ltr\">@cape</span>\n                  </div></a>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"p\">\n                <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cape/status/1141457142614044672\">\n                  <span class=\"FollowButton-bird\">\n                    <div class=\"o n\" aria-label=\"View on Twitter\" title=\"View on Twitter\" role=\"presentation\"></div>\n                  </span></a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"d\">\n              <p class=\"Tweet-text e-entry-title\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n                Exciting times ahead - congrats to team cc <a target=\"_blank\" dir=\"ltr\" data-mentioned-user-id=\"744276787279069200\"\n   class=\"twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewsgould\">\n   @<b>matthewsgould</b></a><a target=\"_blank\" dir=\"ltr\"\n  data-expanded-url=\"https://twitter.com/localglobevc/status/1141340347399835648\" title=\"https://twitter.com/localglobevc/status/1141340347399835648\"\n  class=\"twitter-timeline-link u-hidden\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://t.co/g9lJzXQ2uH\">\n  <span class=\"tco-ellipsis\"></span><span class=\"js-display-url\">twitter.com/localglobevc/s</span><span class=\"tco-ellipsis\">…</span></a>\n              </p>\n              <div class=\"q\">\n                <div class=\"TweetInfo-like\">\n                  <a title=\"Like\" class=\"r\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1141457142614044672\">\n                    <div><div class=\"o m\" aria-label=\"Like\" title=\"Like\" role=\"img\"></div></div>\n                    <span class=\"s\">2</span></a>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"t\">\n                  <a class=\"u-linkBlend\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cape/status/1141457142614044672\">\n                    <time dateTime=\"6/20/2019, 12:26:04 AM\" class=\"dt-updated\"\n                      title=\"Time posted: 2:26 pm - 19 Jun 2019\">\n                      2:26 pm - 19 Jun 2019</time></a>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </blockquote>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Mr <a href=\"/tic\">Cameron said</a> that the UK “wants to work much more closely with Israel on innovation and technology.“, and in fact the British Embassy in Israel has been transformed into a tech hub, because apparently GB and Israel as such great friends (not like Israel, or better say Zionists, are responsible for one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing\">deadliest terrorist attack</a> of the 20th century which killed 91 people including 28 British citizens AND 17 Jews...). Just so we're on the same page, Kleins, Gould, Cameron and Korski are all Jewish, in fact Matthew Gould is a passionate Zionist, whereas a Zionist, according to the <abbr title=\"World Zionist Organization\">WZO</abbr> is <strong>a Jew who understood the Zionist meaning of the Jewish State and was prepared to sacrifice himself for it</strong>. The truth is, Cameron as well as Boris Johnson also declared themselves Zionists, and Cameron received &pound;1m from British Jewry without which he would never have been a PM. And you still think the UK is a democracy in any way?

There's no controversy here: any member of Abrahamic religion be it a Muslim, Jew or Christian, will tell you, that it's all about sovereignty of God. There's only one law, that is the God's law and he's the only one to be worshipped. Creating idols including nation states, is adultly. The state does not own a man, only God does. This is true especially for Jews, and orthodox rabbis confirm that. This truth is really easy to understand yet there's such little number of truly religious men that religion is used to brainwash people in national interests resulting in movements like Zionism that uses Jews as its human shield. That's why M.Gould is facing really serious consequences for his soul when he proclaims himself a Zionist. Not even to mention that corruption/unfair practices are not allowed in Judaism either:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"Row row\">\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      <span style=\"color: blue;\">✡</span> The <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-jews-and-capitalism-call-them-frenemies-1.5455400\">\n  rabbis ordered</a> the owner of a new pizza joint called Calabria to adjust his menu, and start serving ordinary round pies sliced in eight wedges to avoid unfair competition with another pizzeria across the street, known as the Basil Pizza & Wine Bar, which serves the thin-crust saucy type.\n    </blockquote>\n      <p class=\"Solidarity Style\">In the world of the sages before and after, the ideas of a market economy, investment, enterprise and innovation didn’t exist.

But today, it's not anyone's interest to integrate: just throw in anti-semitism accusations and you're good.

Tech Nation and <em>Entrepreneur First</em> are just made for each other. Behind the scenes, EF are getting every single visa they need from Tech Nation without questions asked (this is my <em>opinion</em> which I wanted to prove but the Home Office rejected my Freedom Of Information request because they are scared to reveal the truth, but it's based on a telephone interview I had - see below). In other sectors of Exceptional Talent Visa, you apply for the department that is going to judge you based on your achievements. In technology, you just get a place at EF and you're sorted for the visa that allows you to settle in 3 years' time, even if you drop out of EF in 14 weeks. Good life huh.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div class=\"order-2 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column col-lg-6\">\n    <p>This is because everyone who's been qualified for EF, is a God chosen people who is superior to the scumbags that apply for traditional visas to work as doctors, nurses, teachers. Just think about what this person is saying, because somebody has been selected by Tech Nation, which we know is a fraud, they have privilege over everyone else because they are apparently talented. They ain't no talented, they are just livestock for capitalists to generate investment opportunities. His attitude is so toxic but that's just the amoral culture that they've built for themselves.</p>\n      <p>I had a 10 minute interview with Ali from EF, when I applied there not knowing what they really were i.e., in from the same kindergarten as Tech Nation, and she personally told me they [EF] give the visas usually for 3 years. She didn't even hesitate to say \"we usually give it for 3 years\", because she knows, anyone who gets a place at EF, automatically gets the <em>Tech Nation</em> visa via fast track route. That's the whole purpose of that unethical visa. It's not fair. They don't have the right to decide who can build a business and who doesn't. It's not up to them, yet they act as an authority and pretend like they are saints, because of this degro-culture when everything is handed to them on a plate.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"order-1 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden col-lg-6\" id=\"fig-82466\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f7\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img class=\"ImageHolder border rounded img-fluid\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 540px,(max-width: 991.8px) 720px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 480px,570px\" alt=\"Figure 8: Matt Clifford from EF and his team are priestly caste exempt from immigration rules.\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='679' height='473'/%3E\">\n      <noscript>\n        <picture>\n          <source\n            srcset=\"life-sucks/img/m-576.webp 576w,life-sucks/img/m-319.webp 319w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 540px,(max-width: 991.8px) 720px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 480px,570px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n          <img class=\"border rounded img-fluid\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"Figure 8: Matt Clifford from EF and his team are priestly caste exempt from immigration rules.\" src=\"life-sucks/img/m-576.png\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/m-576.png 576w,life-sucks/img/m-319.png 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 540px,(max-width: 991.8px) 720px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 480px,570px\">\n        </picture>\n      </noscript>\n    </p>\n    <h5\n      id=\"figure-8-matt-clifford-from-ef-and-his-team-are-priestly-caste-exempt-from-immigration-rules\" class=\"m-0 d-inline-block\" style=\"background: white;\">\n      Figure 8: Matt Clifford from EF and his team are priestly caste exempt from immigration rules.\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"position-absolute\" style=\"opacity: 0; top: 1rem; right: 1rem;\" id=\"c5040\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"#\">Go Back</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Referring to the <a\n  href=\"https://medium.com/entrepreneur-first/entrepreneur-first-has-built-over-120-companies-so-who-built-ef-9ab067babab6\">\n  history of EF</a>, we can see they started on 16 July 2012 &mdash; at the same time as Tech Nation and there were special people from the government helping them.

This is why there's no longer a business visa to the UK. It's been renamed to entrepreneur/innovator visa and all the applications have to go through Universities or Accelerators, so that the mafia at the top has full control of which investor gets which piece of the pie in their technocracy tailored for the best pals at the wheel. That's why they are leaving the EU, so that they don't have to abide by the anti-corruption laws and can rob the population as much as they want to.

In a fair society, there would also be orgs like EF, but which underlying motivation is not money and capitalisation.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"ImageHolder float-md-left d-block d-md-inline-block img-fluid\" sizes=\"376px\" alt=\"EF negative Google Maps review\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='376' height='219'/%3E\">\n<noscript>\n  <picture>\n    <source srcset=\"life-sucks/img/cave-319.webp 319w\" sizes=\"376px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n    <img class=\"float-md-left d-block d-md-inline-block img-fluid\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"EF negative Google Maps review\" src=\"life-sucks/img/cave-319.png\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/cave-319.png 319w\" sizes=\"376px\">\n  </picture>\n</noscript> Alice's and Matt's words about helping entrepreneurs is just two-faced propaganda and their personal justification which allows them to sleep at night while the planet is suffocating in plastic and pollution and radical measures against capitalism bred on consumption, are required.

WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING trying to create all this high tech and where is the value for the equity coming from? I don't know.

I was there before any of the EF's member was, yet people who have never been in the UK, never worked for a UK company, never made English friends, have more right to be there than I am because Tech Nation thinks its an authority, and that the society's only way to benefit is from defensive technology.

She then had a year-long placement at St Thomas' just opposite Westminster which is the best placement you can get in England.  When she graduated, she went to a number of interviews. She was offered a place at a hospital, but then they withdrew (such a dick move) because they said they didn't know she needed a visa (when it was advertised otherwise). She then got another job offer from another hospital in London, and starting at level 7.5 and not 7 on their career ladder which is really great considering she's just graduated. And you know what, she couldn't get that job either because it also required the visa NHS couldn't provide.</p>\n    <p>The moral of this story is, we both study in the UK and make friends. She was working part-time for pharmacies and volunteering as a carer pretty much for free, and I was busy getting a bachelors in Computer Science and AI from Sussex, where Margaret Boden (one of the best researchers in AI) is based, then a distinction in Master's in Computer Security from King's College London, then working and starting my own business that is now making the most significant Open Source contributions. And WE're not allowed to continue living in the UK, whereas SOMEONE who's applied to the EF program, and dropped out after 14 weeks, can stay in the UK with the most permissive visa allowing him to work anywhere and apply for citizenship in 3 years. Is that a fair system? But ofc, no visa problems for God chosen \"special talent\" people who have 0 commits on <em>GitHub</em>.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In any way, pharmacists are not even needed today because the prescriptions are delivered by <em>Echo</em>, and Robin Klein is happy with his undisclosed amount (&pound;20 million?) for the exit. And what of the makers of <em>Echo</em>? They just move on to the next job, whereas my company is everything for me and I would never ever sell. Why is this world so degenerate that it is only money that matter? Because they killed God and people don't have proper values any more, it's all money investors exits. One does not have to be religious to understand God, you just need to be a good man, it's really easy, yet the trick is that because religions are full of outdated crap trying to control the population themselves, people feel disaffiliated with them, thinking that there's no God. That's why <em>Art Deco</em> is the alternative &mdash; we can have culture and values, morals and virtues, without being told what to obey. We need to scale down from this technological madness and focus on real human interactions since they are rewarded by evolution with the healthy flow of neurotransmitters, and use technology for support and not as the aim in itself, especially for enrichment.</p>\n\n<p>YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL YOUR COMPANY REMEMBER THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL. You want to work for the better of your community, make profit and grow. This and human interaction is the goal. Forget investors, they are just owning you for their own agenda. Yet it's on everyone's mind \"how  much percent should I give up and for how much cash\"... Just calm down it's wrong. See because I think this way I can't get the visa as I can't serve their interest and they can't capitalise on me.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-6\">\n    <img class=\"ImageHolder img-fluid\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 50vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\" alt=\"Boris Johnson's tax plans\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1162' height='782'/%3E\">\n    <noscript>\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"life-sucks/img/tax-plans-1140.webp 1140w,life-sucks/img/tax-plans-768.webp 768w,life-sucks/img/tax-plans-576.webp 576w,life-sucks/img/tax-plans-319.webp 319w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 50vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n        <img class=\"img-fluid\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"Boris Johnson's tax plans\" src=\"life-sucks/img/tax-plans-1140.png\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/tax-plans-1140.png 1140w,life-sucks/img/tax-plans-768.png 768w,life-sucks/img/tax-plans-576.png 576w,life-sucks/img/tax-plans-319.png 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 50vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\">\n      </picture>\n    </noscript>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-6\">\n    <img class=\"ImageHolder img-fluid\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 50vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\" alt=\"Wages flatten\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1162' height='782'/%3E\">\n    <noscript>\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"life-sucks/img/wages-1140.webp 1140w,life-sucks/img/wages-768.webp 768w,life-sucks/img/wages-576.webp 576w,life-sucks/img/wages-319.webp 319w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 50vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n        <img class=\"img-fluid\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"Wages flatten\" src=\"life-sucks/img/wages-1140.png\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/wages-1140.png 1140w,life-sucks/img/wages-768.png 768w,life-sucks/img/wages-576.png 576w,life-sucks/img/wages-319.png 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 50vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\">\n      </picture>\n    </noscript>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The UK's economy contracted by -0.2 in the previous quarter, and although it recovered to 0.3%, <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-growth\">year-on-year, the economy grew</a> 1 percent the weakest pace of expansion since the first quarter of 2010. If the accelerators like <em>EF</em>, and <em>Tech Nation</em> are working so hard, why is there no benefit to the economy? The reason is because capitalists are not interested in economic growth, since the worse off everyone else is, the better off they are on differential scale. Capitalism is a mode of power &mdash; those who get their riches strive to protect them at all price and because they don't have soul that would allow them to understand that the meaning of life consists of building communities, they set up agencies and manipulate the political landscape to their advantage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"position-relative row\">\n  <div class=\"order-2 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column col-lg-6\">\n    <p>Watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTpanudMToA\">the video</a> that explains what differential mode of power means. \"Far from being a distortion of contemporary capitalism, slowing growth may be part of its very logic\".</p>\n      <p>In case of technology, agencies like <em>Tech Nation</em> are precisely there to pervert all meaning of talent in IT via providing places only for candidates selected by the elite for their technology warehouses.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"order-1 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column mb-3 p-3 rounded position-relative overflow-hidden col-lg-6\" id=\"fig-97934\">\n    <div class=\" Parallax\" data-loading style=\"z-index: -1;\" id=\"c709f10\"></div>\n    <div style=\"z-index: -1;\" class=\"Parallax\"></div>\n    <noscript>\n      <div class=\" Parallax\" style=\"background-image: url(/img/letters/background.png); z-index: -1;\"></div>\n    </noscript>\n    <p class=\"text-center\">\n      <img class=\"border rounded img-fluid\" alt=\"Figure 11: Can Capitalists Afford Economic Growth? &amp;amp;amp;copy; Creorder\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='350' height='197'/%3E\" data-io>\n      <noscript>\n        <img class=\"border rounded img-fluid\" alt=\"Figure 11: Can Capitalists Afford Economic Growth? &amp;amp;amp;copy; Creorder\" src=\"life-sucks/img/growth.gif\">\n      </noscript>\n    </p>\n    <h5 id=\"figure-11-can-capitalists-afford-economic-growth-copy-creorder\" class=\"m-0 d-inline-block\"\n      style=\"background: white;\">\n      Figure 11: Can Capitalists Afford Economic Growth? &copy; Creorder\n    </h5>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"position-absolute\" style=\"opacity: 0; top: 1rem; right: 1rem;\" id=\"ce427\">\n    <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" href=\"#\">Go Back</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>EF</em> wraps their proposition like they are helping young entrepreneurs, but in fact its their privileged money-holders who win the most. For example, if out of 100 places in EF, 20 new companies are set up, and there's a 2000 shares pot, each person gets 90% of their own company or 90 shares, but overall EF's investors receive 10% x 20 = 200 shares which makes them almost twice as powerful than each individual new company owner. <em>Tech Nation</em>'s job is also to make sure that no <strong>Open Source</strong> developers are let through, so that the capitalists don't have to compete with them. This is not what the UK's population is paying them money for.</p>\n\n<p>It's Open Source, inclusive anarchy <em>VS</em> defensive, corporate capitalism and we need to clearly define the terms and conditions of this battle by updating our licenses. For example, under my <a href=\"https://art-deco.github.io/license/\"><strong>Art Deco</strong> License</a> (AD-1), no company can use my software in the UK for commercial reason without acknowledging that they are not represented by liars from <em>Tech Nation</em>. <em>Tech Nation</em> shamelessly exploits the community without representing a single person from it, only to justify their completely unethical application process, in which not a single expert is even involved. They look &mdash; is this person known in the community? Is he capable of getting out there and brainwashing everyone that UK tech is good, while in the background our <em>Conservative</em> lords and their pals loot the country's treasury?

They ought to be ashamed. Jews defending themselves against persecution and aggression have my full support ...\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The professional Zionist Shinwell shames those who voted against British interference in the Suez because apparently Israel was just defending itself. Well, as it really turned out, it was British + French + Israeli conspiracy known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_of_S%C3%A8vres\">Protocol of Sèvres</a> to attack Egypt which failed miserably after the US didn't join them and their real motives were uncovered. My point being, everyone has and always will be shamed for even mentioning the word Jew in a conversation which is unfavourable to someone who wants to use his/her Jewish identity to cover up their dirty deeds. When Ireland passed the sanctions on Israel, being the first ever country to act on the violations of international law by Israel, who occupies Syrian and Palestinian land, they were immediately called anti-semitic by Netanyahu's office.</p>\n\n<p>On 25 November 1940, Jewish paramilitary organisation in Mandatory Palestine Haganah, planted and detonated a bomb on <em>SS Patria</em> ocean liner, killing 267 people and injuring 172. They did in because British authorities were deporting about 1,800 Jewish refugees that previously came from Nazi-occupied Europe from Palestine because they didn't have visas. Zionists didn't like this fact because they wanted all Jews to remain. So what do they do? They bomb these poor people who were saved from Nazis, themselves. This is just so you get the picture whether Zionists and Israel have really anything to do with Judaism.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>11 May 2010 &mdash; David Cameron elected as Prime Minister of the UK.</li>\n  <li>September 2010 Matthew Gould takes up the post of British ambassador to Israel.

If you think Israeli tech is really great, you should remember how when in the most crucial moment when it was needed, that is during the 7/7 London bombings, none of the security cameras installed on London buses could record the videos. Just like these security systems, the new health systems of the UK will also fail when relied upon the most. After they put 5G in there, people will start getting brain cancers. THEY will see this data, and install more 5G antennas, BenevolentAI will come up with a medicine against it, and it will be distributed to you by post via the Echo App. You're all now slaves in the UK's technocratic society and there's no exit.</p>\n\n<p>What I want, is for Tech Nation to be properly investigated with a special commission that would reveal the truth that not a single expert is ever involved in the decision process. I want GovTech to cease to exist, and be replaced by <strong>BritTech</strong> / <strong>Britech</strong> or <strong>BritishTech</strong>, a 100% high-quality home GB technology that can be exported, a nation-wide software company that receives the requirements from the government and implements them. After young people complete university degrees in Computer Science (and its branches including Security, AI), they can go work there on projects that are required for the country, and not for corporations. This will unite people, give them a national idea and actually restore the communal values, which has been completely destroyed by \"innovators\" who are only there to stick their filthy hands into the money pot, for which the population works so hard.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\" style=\"background: #8b160b;\">\n  <div class=\"order-lg-2 pr-0 d-flex align-items-end justify-content-end col-lg-6\">\n    <img class=\"ImageHolder img-fluid\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 525px,(max-width: 991.8px) 705px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 465px,555px\" alt=\"Workers of all countries unite.\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1365' height='1156'/%3E\">\n    <noscript>\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"life-sucks/img/marx3-1140.webp 1140w,life-sucks/img/marx3-768.webp 768w,life-sucks/img/marx3-576.webp 576w,life-sucks/img/marx3-319.webp 319w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 525px,(max-width: 991.8px) 705px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 465px,555px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n        <img class=\"img-fluid\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"Workers of all countries unite.\" src=\"life-sucks/img/marx3-1140.jpg\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/marx3-1140.jpg 1140w,life-sucks/img/marx3-768.jpg 768w,life-sucks/img/marx3-576.jpg 576w,life-sucks/img/marx3-319.jpg 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 525px,(max-width: 991.8px) 705px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 465px,555px\">\n      </picture>\n    </noscript>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"order-lg-1 pt-2 col-lg-6\" style=\"color: white;\">\n    <h2 id=\"britech-the-british-software\">Britech™: The British Software</h2>\n    <p>Software can and should be made using requirements specification, with waterfall/agile methodology.

THEY are the reason why no one can live peacefully and enjoy the simplicity of life, but instead has to join the rat race when the interest rate devalues years' worth of the hard work.</p>\n    <p>You MUST vote Labour to have the real old-school traditional <strong>Great British</strong> values in <strong>Computing</strong> to be restored so that you can live in a <em>FREE</em>, calm country, the country of men of covenant who have the deeper spiritual link with <strong>God</strong> who will always guide and protect them.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"row mb-3\" style=\"background: #292f0d;\">\n  <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n    <img class=\"ImageHolder img-fluid\" style=\"mix-blend-mode: lighten;\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 510px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\" alt=\"Art Deco Chandelier\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='3096' height='2312'/%3E\">\n    <noscript>\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"life-sucks/img/chand-1140.webp 1140w,life-sucks/img/chand-768.webp 768w,life-sucks/img/chand-576.webp 576w,life-sucks/img/chand-319.webp 319w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 510px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n        <img class=\"img-fluid\" style=\"mix-blend-mode: lighten;\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"Art Deco Chandelier\" src=\"life-sucks/img/chand-1140.jpg\" srcset=\"life-sucks/img/chand-1140.jpg 1140w,life-sucks/img/chand-768.jpg 768w,life-sucks/img/chand-576.jpg 576w,life-sucks/img/chand-319.jpg 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 510px,(max-width: 991.8px) 330px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 450px,540px\">\n      </picture>\n    </noscript>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"pt-1 col-md-6\" style=\"color: white;\">\n    <h2 id=\"etc\">ETC</h2>\n    <p>Hey guys, I wanted to make a video with the explanation about Tech Nation's atrocities but I've run out of time. For 1 year, I've been maintaining a web-site at technation.sucks with all the info there, but the real purpose of that was to work on my static website generator. It's been great time but when the video comes out, you'll be able to see in 2 secs that I speaketh the truth. I speak so passionately about software only because I know what I'm talking about.</p>\n    <a id=\"subscribe-btn\" class=\"float-right btn btn-lg btn-warning\" href=\"#\">SUBSCRIBE</a>\n    <p>Meanwhile, to be notified on updates on this website, please use ANONYMOUS web-push subscribe notifications using the buttons below.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"share-now\">SHARE NOW!</h2>\n\n<div class=\"SplendidSharingButtons mb-3\">\n  <span id=\"cffa1\"><span class=\"d-inline-block\" style=\"height:40px\" data-loading>Loading sharing buttons...</span><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to Share</noscript></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>The images from Wired, EF, NHS, Daily Mail, Tech Nation, Business Insider are used for non-commercial private research purpose.
